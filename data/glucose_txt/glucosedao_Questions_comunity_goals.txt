What are the main goals of the GlucoseDao community?
GlucoseDAO has three primary goals focused on democratizing glucose data and prediction:

Data Collection and Sharing
-Establish a decentralized open database of blood glucose values from CGM devices
-Collect volunteer-contributed data including health and lifestyle variables
-Address the current limitation of existing datasets which only include dozens of people monitored for short periods

Technical Development
-Train and fine-tune models to predict blood glucose trends
-Contribute models and datasets to the GlucoBench benchmark
-Create user-friendly implementations of prediction models for everyday use

Community Governance
-Establish a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to govern data collection and development
-Develop protocols for sharing glucose data
-Implement smart contracts to reward participants when their data is used in commercial applications

The project aims to benefit both people with medical conditions and health-conscious individuals interested in optimizing their longevity through better glucose 
management
