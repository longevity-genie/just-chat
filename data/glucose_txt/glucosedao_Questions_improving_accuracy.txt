How does GlucoseDao plan to improve glucose prediction accuracy?
GlucoseDAO's approach to improving glucose prediction accuracy involves a combination of 
data collection and benchmarking strategies:

Data Collection Approach (resulting in a larger and more diverse dataset)
-microstudy that combines Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data with movement data to build comprehensive prediction models.
-users can contribute their data to the dataset
-researchers can use the dataset to train their models or to test new models/theories

Benchmarking Strategy
-The project is developing a unique benchmarking method through a game where users predict glucose value changes 
-for the next hour. This human prediction rate will serve as a baseline to validate their model's effectiveness.

Technical Implementation
-Created an open-source project available on GitHub
-Focuses on data integration capabilities for users
-Maintains open datasets for collaborative improvement

This approach is scientifically sound, as research has shown that for 30-minute prediction horizons, well-designed models 
can achieve 95.8-99.7% clinically acceptable predictions1. The inclusion of additional physiological data, particularly 
during physical activity, has been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy. (see 2.1 from glucosedao_online_links_for_reference.txt)

What specific technologies will GlucoseDao use to enhance glucose prediction accuracy?
-Multi-Source Data Integration
-Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) as the primary data source
-Smartwatch sensor data including heart rate and step detection1
-Accelerometry data for physical activity tracking
-Machine Learning Architecture

Performance Metrics
This technical approach could achieve:
-15-minute predictions with RMSE of 0.19mmol/L and 99% clinical safety
-60-minute predictions with RMSE of 0.59mmol/L and 98% clinical safety
(see 2.2 from glucosedao_online_links_for_reference.txt)

-Improved accuracy by removing reliance on manual activity logging
(see 2.3 from glucosedao_online_links_for_reference.txt)

Real-time Processing
The system would implement:
-Edge computing for real-time model inference
-Continuous data collection and processing from wearable devices
-Automated activity monitoring to replace manual documentation
