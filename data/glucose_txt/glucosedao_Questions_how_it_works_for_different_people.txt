How does GlucoseDao ensure the portability of their predictive models across different individuals?

Data Standardization
-Implement data normalization across different CGM devices and measurement units
-Create standardized formats for auxiliary data like movement and lifestyle factors
-Use semantic web resources and ontologies to maintain consistent data interpretation

Model Architecture
-Develop transfer learning approaches to adapt base models to individual characteristics
-Include personalization layers that can be fine-tuned for each user
-Create a hierarchical structure that captures both population-level and individual patterns

Validation Framework
-Set specific thresholds for acceptable accuracy loss during model transfer
-Evaluate model performance across diverse user groups
-Test models across different glucose monitoring devices and conditions
