GlucoseDAO is an innovative decentralized science project focused on glucose prediction and health optimization,
combining technology with community-driven healthcare solutions.

Project Overview
Core Mission
The project aims to develop an open-source glucose prediction system while building a collaborative community
focused on health and longevity. The initiative addresses a significant market, with 6.7% of the global population 
being diabetic and approximately one-third interested in health awareness and lifestyle improvement.

Technical Development
-Created an open-source glucose prediction repository using an open-source transformer model
-Launched a microstudy collecting CGM and movement data(still in progress)
-Developing a human prediction benchmark game (since there is no golden standard for glucose prediction)
-Maintaining public Huggingface models and datasets

Achievements and Recognition
-Secured aprox $2,000 funding from DesciFunding GG21
-Presented research at ARDD 2024 as a figure in a poster
-Conducted presentations at Zelar and HEALES longevity meetings
